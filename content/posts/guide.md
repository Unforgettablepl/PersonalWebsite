This guide has been created by me to serve as a simple 'Getting Started' guide for people for the Indian Computing Olympiads (ZCO, ZIO, and INOI).

I won't go into detail about topics which are not Indian Olympiad specific, and will instead provide external links in such cases.

<div class="block danger">
    This guide will not give any advice for the TSTs(Team Selection Tests) or the IOI. Only basic information about these stages will be given. This has been done to prevent a conflict of interest and protect the personal interests of the author.

## Q: So what is the Indian Computing Olympiad anyways?

The Indian Computing Olympiad is the process used to select the Indian team for the [International Olympiad of Informatics](https://ioinformatics.org/). The IOI is one of the most prestigious olympiads on the face of the earth. You can also look at [this](https://usaco.guide/general/intro-cp).

## Q: Why should I care about it? Will it help me anywhere?

While there is no monetary award associated with the Olympiad, it can help you get admission to a good university. Here are some observations I made last year (IOITC 2024):

- All INOI Silver Medalists who qualified for IOITC got accepted by IIT-GN.
- All INOI Gold Medalists were accepted by IIIT-H.

Furthermore, if you make it to the Indian Team and win a medal at IOI, you are pretty much guaranteed a seat at NUS (National University of Singapore).

_IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras have also announced admissions via Olympiads. These were introduced in the 2024-2025 cycle, and the results are not out yet. I will update this page whenever I procure the results for this year._

Olympiads also look good on resumes when you apply for jobs.

<div class="block danger">
⚠ Do not keep Olympiad as your only option for getting into a good university, especially if you are in Class 12. With the Olympiad, missing the IOITC cutoff by even a single mark could leave you with nothing in your hand. <i>I personally know some people who were ruined this way</i>.

⚠ There are negligible incentives to just clearing ZCO/ZIO or winning a bronze medal at INOI.

# Getting Started

Please take a look at the [official ICO website](https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/) before continuing. _This guide presumes that you have completely read that webpage._

# About the stages

The Indian Computing Olympiad is made up of 3 stages:

ZCO,ZIO -> INOI -> IOITC -> IOI (*YAY!! :D*)

<div class="block warning">
ZIO is the only exam that follows a paper-and-pen exam style. That is, you will get questions you'll have to solve by hand or with a simple calculator (Available <a href="https://www.tcsion.com/OnlineAssessment/ScientificCalculator/Calculator.html">here</a>). <b>This guide will not go into any further detail about this exam.</b>
</div>

All problems (ZCO, INOI, IOITC, and IOI) are scored out of **100 points** and your score on an exam is the **sum** of your scores across each problem.

// TODO: Explain how subtasks work

The ZCO is a **3 hour** exam usually held from **2:00 PM** to **5:00 PM**. It comprises of **2 problems**. The cutoffs are usually class and gender based, with lower classes (VIII and below) and females getting a preference.

The INOI is a **3 hour** exam usually held from **2:00 PM** to **5:00 PM**. It comprises of **3 problems**. The cutoffs are usually class and gender based, with lower classes (VIII and below) and females getting a preference. In INOI, medals are also awarded. These are strictly merit-based with around 10 Golds, 20 Silvers, and 30 Bronzes awarded every year. Moreover, **girls** are also selected for the EGOI selection test.

It should be noted that, class and gender based cutoffs hardly make any difference in the cutoffs for ZCO, as anyone good enough to clear INOI is usually able to clear ZCO with a big margin. However, in INOI, for the IOITC cutoffs, females have a significant advantage. In the last 3 years, the cutoff for 12th Grade Females was lower than the cutoff for 8th Grade Males by about 40/300 marks. I have provided the cutoffs for the last few years at the end of this guide, under the resources section.

If you make it to IOITC, you can give the TSTs (Team Selection Tests). These are conducted for **3 days**, and are **5 hours** with **3 problems** each. The total score is taken as the sum of your score across every problem across every day. The top 4 scorers from the Indian delegation to the IOI. One should note that the style of problems in TSTs is significantly different than INOI. I have talked more about this afterwards.

# How to start out

If you want to get started with competitive programming, you first need to learn a programming language. You might also want to look at [this](https://usaco.guide/general/intro-cp).

## Q: Which language should I learn?

The only language allowed at INOI, IOITC, and IOI is C++. ZCO allows Python and Java in addition to C++. As mentioned above, there are negligible advantages to just clearing ZCO. Therefore, **I would recommend learning C++ directly**. Also, if you are reading this guide close to the zonal stage, you might want to focus on ZIO instead since it requires no programming knowledge.

Another thing to note is that these Olympiads don't require advanced programming knowledge. You should know the basics of the language you are planning to use, and most importantly the Standard Library. Knowledge about Classes and Structs is useful but not required. Knowledge about advanced OOP concepts and any custom libraries is not useful.

## Q: I learnt a language. What next?

You should start learning some **standard algorithms** now.

# Commentary on Exams

## General

Remember that these are **competitive** exams. All the problems are not meant to be fully solveable in order to qualify for the next stage. Your focus should be on getting more points. A (70+70) beats (100+0).

## ZCO

In ZCO, getting the casework and bruteforceable subtasks should be enough for qualification. The cutoffs are usually extremely low (<40/200).

## INOI

In INOI, the time per problem is only 1 hour. While this may seem like a lot of time, it is not. The emphasis in this round is on speed as compared to raw problem solving skills. Identifying and solving problems using standard algorithms would be enough to move on to the next stage. For this stage, I would highly recommend practising using **Mock Contests**. The problems in mock contests don't necessarily have to be PYQs. The Singaporean NOI is good source of problems which are INOI level.

## IOITC

As previously mentioned, no commentary will be made on TSTs.

## APIO

APIO is a pretty hard contest. You should be atleast INOI Gold level if you are planning to try for a medal at APIO.

## EGOI

_I will update this section when I have some comments from someone from the Indian EGOI Team._
