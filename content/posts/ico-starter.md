This is the first part in a 3-part series:

- _[A deep dive on INOI]() (Coming Soon)_

This guide has been created by me to serve as a simple 'Getting Started' guide for people for the Indian Computing Olympiads (ZCO, ZIO, and INOI).

## Q: So what is the Indian Computing Olympiad anyways?

The Indian Computing Olympiad is the process used to select the Indian team for the _[International Olympiad of Informatics](https://ioinformatics.org/)_. The IOI is one of the most prestigious competitions on the face of the earth.

You can also look at _[this](https://usaco.guide/general/intro-cp)_ to find out more about this subject.

The Indian Computing Olympiad is organized by the _[IARCS](https://www.iarcs.org.in/)_ (Indian Association for Research in Computing Science). The official website is at _[this link](https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/)_.

## Q: Why should I care about it? Will it help me anywhere?

While there is no monetary award associated with the Olympiad, it can help you get admission to a good university. Here are some observations I made last year (IOITC 2024):

- All **INOI Gold Medalists** were admitted into IIIT-H.
- All **INOI Silver Medalists** who qualified for IOITC got admitted into IIT-GN.

Furthermore, if you make it to the Indian Team and win a medal at IOI, you are pretty much guaranteed an admission at NUS (National University of Singapore).

_IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras have also announced admissions via Olympiads. These were introduced in the 2024-2025 cycle, and the results are not out yet. I will update this page whenever I procure the results for this year._

Olympiads also look good on resumes when you apply for jobs.

⚠ Do not keep Olympiad as your only option for getting into a good university, especially if you are in Class 12. With the Olympiad, missing the IOITC cutoff by even a single mark could leave you with nothing in your hand. <i>I personally know some people who were ruined this way</i>.

⚠ There are negligible incentives to just clearing ZCO/ZIO or winning a bronze medal at INOI.

## About the stages

The Indian Computing Olympiad is made up of 3 stages:

ZCO, ZIO → INOI → IOITC → IOI (*YAY!! :D*)

<div class="block warning">
ZIO is the only exam that follows a paper-and-pen exam style. That is, you will get questions you'll have to solve by hand or with a simple calculator (<i>Available <a href="https://www.tcsion.com/OnlineAssessment/ScientificCalculator/Calculator.html">here</a></i>).
</div>

All problems (ZCO, INOI, IOITC, and IOI) are scored out of **100 points** and your score on an exam is the **sum** of your scores across each problem. Each problem usually has _subtasks_ which allow you to get partial credit.

The ZCO is a **3 hour** exam usually held from **2:00 PM** to **5:00 PM**. It comprises of **2 problems**. The cutoffs are usually class and gender based, with lower classes (VIII and below) and females getting a preference.

The INOI is a **3 hour** exam usually held from **2:00 PM** to **5:00 PM**. It comprises of **3 problems**. The cutoffs are usually class and gender based, with lower classes (VIII and below) and females getting a preference. In INOI, medals are also awarded. These are strictly merit-based with around 10 Golds, 20 Silvers, and 30 Bronzes awarded every year. Moreover, **girls** are also selected for the EGOI selection test.

It should be noted that, class and gender based cutoffs hardly make any difference in the cutoffs for ZCO, as anyone good enough to clear INOI is usually able to clear ZCO with a big margin. However, in INOI, for the IOITC cutoffs, females have a significant advantage. In the last 3 years, the cutoff for 12th Grade Females was lower than the cutoff for 8th Grade Males by about 40/300 marks. The cutoffs for the last few years can also be found on this website, under the data section.

If you make it to IOITC, you can give the TSTs (_Team Selection Tests_). These select the Indian deligation for the IOI.

INOI Silver and Gold medalists are also eligible for the APIO (_Asia Pacific Informatics Olympiad_).

<div class="block warning">
    The APIO, TSTs, and IOI are not covered in this guide as their format is very different from the INOI and ZCO. The difference is mainly in the style and difficulty of problems.

## Resources

Let me use this section to promote SPOI ([_Shortest Path to IOI_](https://spoi.org.in)). It is an intiative by me and my friends to help students prepare for the Indian Computing Olympiad. We have a lot of resources, including a big discord server where you can meet other students preparing for the Olympiad. As far as my knowledge goes, this is the only community of this kind.
