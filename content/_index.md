I am Samik Goyal, an IOI-2024, IOI-2025, and IOAI-2025 Silver medallist from India. I also love cycling and running (PR: 40KM and 16KM). I love singleplayer story games, and my favourite game is Far Cry 5. I love Fountain Pens, my favourite being the Lamy Safari (Kinda basic, but I love it :3).

This website is my personal blog where I share my personal experiences, tips, and ideas. It is highly opinionated. I also share my achievements and projects here.
